- problem statement: followers have a fixed budget for creators when they donate
- speculation: there are no tools for followers to divide donation budget to their liking

- requirements: build a tool to help followers calulate how much money they want to donate to their creators
every month

maybe build a cli tool first

then expand the logic as an api backend with swaggers

then expand to a web frontend
